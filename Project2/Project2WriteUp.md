<b>Description of your app including your app's inspiration and goal.</b><br/>
My app will be a pocket piano app where the goal for this app is to be able to play a simple song on a one-octave range. 

<b>Define your app's intended audience. Who will be using your app? What problem is your app solving for them?</b><br/>
The inteded audience is anyone. The app is not addressing any particular problem; it's mainly for entertainment purposes.

<b>Do some research -- do similar apps exist? If so, how will yours be better or different? Research enough to know that what you're proposing is possible.</b><br/>
Similar apps already exists on the Google Play store such as https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamestar.perfectpiano&hl=en. I will first try to get the functionality of sound when a 
key is pressed before trying to make my app different from other pocket piano apps. My goal is to get to a point where I can experiment with touch events in Android measuring speed, location, duration to 
produce a similar noise a real piano would make.

<b>Where will you get any content needed for your app? This could include text, formulas, whatever your app requires.</b><br/>
I will photoshop all the needed images. As for sound, I'm not so sure yet. I might have to look around for existing mp3 files of piano notes only before the worst case event, which is just recording an actual piano.
