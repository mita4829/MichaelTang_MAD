# Project 1 Writeup
* Description of your app including your app's inspiration and goal:<br/>
My app is a chess app that allows two players to play together without wifi over bluetooth. 
* Define your app's intended audience. Who will be using your app? What problem is your app solving for them?<br/>
The intended audience are those who enjoy to play chess, in particular playing with friends without the overhead of connecting to a server or miscellaneous registration with online chess platforms. Just open the app, connect with bluetooth with people nearby and start playing.
* Do some research -- do similar apps exist? If so, how will yours be better or different? Research enough to know that what you're proposing is possible.<br/>
Yes there are other bluetooth chess apps. At this current moment, most searches on bluetooth chess apps return poorly rated apps due to the overhead of setting up a connect via bluetooth. The advantage of my app will be to reduce the connectivity issues by sandboxing each step of the connectivity and adding assurance checks. If a connection step fails, itâ€™ll output an detailed error, as opposed to other apps that preforms the connectivity all at once and just return a fail/success message.
* Where will you get any content needed for your app? This could include text, formulas, whatever your app requires.<br/>
I will be photoshopping all my chess pieces. As for algorithms, I will be translating my old chess algorithm written in C++ into Swift.
